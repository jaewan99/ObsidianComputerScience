Virtual memory is a memory management technique used by operating systems to give the appearance of a large, continuous block of memory to applications, even if the physical memory (RAM) is limited. It allows larger applications to run on systems with less RAM.

가상메모리의 목적
- To support multiprogramming , it allows more than one program to run at the same time.
- - A program doesn’t need to be fully loaded in memory to run. Only the needed parts are loaded.
- Programs can be bigger than the physical memory available in the system.
- - Virtual memory creates the illusion of a large memory, even if the actual memory (RAM) is small.
- - It uses both RAM and disk storage to manage memory, loading only parts of programs into RAM as needed.
- - This allows the system to run more programs at once and manage memory more efficiently.!
