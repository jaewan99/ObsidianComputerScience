A Client-Server Transaction
- Most network applications are based on the client-server model:
	- A server process and one or more client processes
	- Server manages some resource
	- Server provides service by manipulating resource for clients
	- Server activated by request from client (vending machine analogy

	- From the hardware perspective, the interface to a between the network and your computer is called NIC, or network interface card
		- ![[Pasted image 20251031170714.png]]
		- Network interface card
		- The interesting thing is that it looks to your computer like an I/O device
		- And unix API dealing with networks, make it looks like a file.
- Computer Networks
	- A network is a hierarchical system of boxes and wires organized by geographical proximity
		- SAN (System Area Network) spans cluster or machine room
			- Switched Ethernet, Quadrics QSW, ...
		- LAN (Local Area Network) spans a building or campus
			- Ethernet is most prominent example
		- WAN (Wide Area Network) spans country or world
			- Typically high-speed point-to-point phone lines
	- An internetwork (internet) is an interconnected set of networks
		- The Global IP Internet (uppercase "I") is the most famous example of an internet (lowercase "i")
- Lowest Level: Ethernet Segment
	- ![[Pasted image 20251031171146.png]]
	- Ethernet segment consists of a collection of hosts connected by wires (twisted pairs) to a hub
		-  Sharing a single communication channel
	- Spans room or floor in a building
	- Operation
		- Each Ethernet adapter has a unique 48-bit address (MAC address)
			- E.g., 00:16:ea:e3:54:e6
		- Hosts send bits to any other host in chunks called frames
		- Hub slavishly copies each bit from each port to every other port
			- Every host sees every bit
		- Note: Hubs are obsolete. Bridges (switches, routers) became cheap enough to replace them
- Next Level: Bridged Ethernet Segment
	- ![[Pasted image 20251031171158.png]]
	- Spans building or campus
	- Bridges cleverly learn which hosts are reachable from which ports and then selectively copy frames from port to port
- Conceptual View of LANs
	- For simplicity, hubs, bridges, and wires are often shown as a collection of hosts attached to a single wire:
	- Bunch of hosts, where they can easily communication on one other
	- ![[Pasted image 20251031171326.png]]
- Next Level: internets
	- Multiple incompatible LANs can be physically connected by specialized computers called routers
	- The connected networks are called an internet (lower case)
	- ![[Pasted image 20251031171416.png]]
	- LAN 1 and LAN 2 might be completely different, totally incompatible (e.g., Ethernet, Fibre Channel, 802.11*, T1-links, DSL, …)
- Logical Structure of an internet
	- Whole bunch of host spread potentially all across the world and then some magical system of routers that will get a message from one place to the other, based on the mode of addressing. And it will hub through multiple routers to get from one place to the other.
	- ![[Pasted image 20251031171722.png]]
	- Ad hoc interconnection of networks
		- No particular topology
		- Vastly different router & link capacities
	- Send packets from source to destination by hopping through networks
		- Router forms bridge from one network to another
		- Different packets may take different routes
- The Notion of an internet Protocol
	- How is it possible to send bits across incompatible LANs and WANs?
	- Solution: protocol software running on each host and router
		- Protocol is a set of rules that governs how hosts and routers should cooperate when they transfer data from network to network.
		- Smooths out the differences between the different networks
- What Does an internet Protocol Do?
	- Provides a naming scheme
		- An internet protocol defines a uniform format for host addresses
		- Each host (and router) is assigned at least one of these internet addresses that uniquely identifies it
	- Provides a delivery mechanism
		- An internet protocol defines a standard transfer unit (packet)
			- packets are around 1000-2000 bytes
		- Packet consists of header and payload
			- Header: contains info such as packet size, source and destination addresses
			- Payload: contains data bits sent from source host
- Transferring internet data via encapsulation
	- we want to send a packet from Host A to Host B
	- ![[Pasted image 20251031173341.png]]
	- Idea of packet communication
		-  Put little headers on that contain the routing information equivalent on the front of an envelope of a letter
	- The LAN1 adapter, the network interface card or adaptor 
		- is responsible for putting that out over this local communication capability
	- LAN2 - puts its own frame header
		- Encapsulation, decapsulation.
- Global IP Internet
	- Based on the TCP/IP protocol family
		- IP (Internet Protocol)
			- Provides basic naming scheme and unreliable delivery capability of packets (datagrams) from host-to-host
		- UDP (Unreliable Datagram Protocol)
			- Uses IP to provide unreliable datagram delivery from process-to-process
		- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - 99%
			- Uses IP to provide reliable byte streams from process-to-process over connections
	- Accessed via a mix of Unix file I/O and functions from the sockets interface

- A Programmer’s View of the Internet
	- 1. Hosts are mapped to a set of 32-bit IP addresses
