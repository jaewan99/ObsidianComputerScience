Introduction
actual code that runs in the computer - bytes that run that the processor execute
assembly - the word form of the bytes
machine code - object code, binary code, assembly code

machine code is the intermediate form between what the program is trying to do and machine is trying to do

- Intel is complex instruction set computer

- Broadwell model
	- PCle - connection to the peripheral devices 
	- DDR - to connect to main memory
	- SATA - is connection to different types of dics
	- USB
	- Ethernet - is the connection to the network connection

- Instruction set - target of the a compiler to give you a series of instructions that tell the machine exactly what to do
- Instruction set architecture - What the target of a compiler should be and then let the hardware people figure out how best to implement it
- Microarchitecture - lower level; how it actually gets implement.
