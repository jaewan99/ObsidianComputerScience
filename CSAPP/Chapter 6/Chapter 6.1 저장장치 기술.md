- Random-Access Memory (RAM)
	- RAM is traditionally packaged as a chip.
	- Basic storage unit is normally a **cell** (one bit per cell).
	- Multiple RAM chips from a memory.
- RAM comes in two varieties:
	- SRAM (Static RAM) - 정적
	- DRAM (Dynamic RAM) - 동적

- The CPU-Memory Gap
	- to make their processors faster they would just double the clock frequency. they decreased the feature size of the chips that they were making- that would allow to put things closer together, and then increase the clock frequency by a proportional amount.
	- In 2003, they cant handled the heat generated from decreasing the size of the chip
		- So now they subdivided a CPU chip into individual processors cores
		- by running in parallel, you can more effective - the effective CPU cycle time go down
	- The only way to really get more performance, is to increase the number of independent cores
