- Principle Locality 
	- the programs tend to use data and instructions whose addresses are near or equal to those that they have used recently
- Temporal locality:
	- Recently referenced items are likely to be referenced again in the near future
- Spatial locality
	- Items with nearby addresses tend to be referenced close together in time 
- Good locality = Good performance
